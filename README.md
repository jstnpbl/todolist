# Smart To-Do List

An advanced To-Do List application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app helps you manage your tasks efficiently with features like task filtering, priority levels, due dates, and a dark mode.

## Features
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Manage your tasks with ease.
- **Task Prioritization**: Assign priority levels (low, medium, high) to tasks.
- **Due Dates**: Set due dates and get alerts for overdue tasks.
- **Filters**: View all tasks, active tasks, or completed tasks.
- **Search**: Quickly find tasks using the search bar.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize task completion with a progress bar.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and task management.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jstnpbl/todolist.git

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
In the near future, I plan to implement the following enhancements:

- **Enhanced Task Creation:** Prompt users to set the priority level (High, Medium, Low) and a deadline when adding a new task, rather than setting them separately.
- **Improved Deadline Display:** Present the deadline for each task in a clear and user-friendly format.
- **Minor UI/UX Improvements:** Continue to refine the user interface for better intuitiveness and visual appeal.

### Potential Future Ideas
These are more ambitious features that may be explored in the longer term:

- Implement a tagging system for better task categorization.
- Add reminders and notifications (e.g., browser-based).
- Explore a basic calendar view integration.
- Consider a more significant UI/UX redesign.
- Investigate the feasibility of a mobile-responsive design or a basic mobile app.
